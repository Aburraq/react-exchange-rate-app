# Exchange App

## Overview
The Turkish Lira has been highly volatile in recent years, experiencing significant fluctuations in value due to various economic and political factors. This volatility inspired the creation of this exchange app, designed to help users stay updated with real-time exchange rates and make informed financial decisions. The app provides a reliable platform for tracking currency exchange rates, crucial for both personal and business financial planning in such a dynamic environment.

## Prop Drilling and State Management
Prop drilling, the process of passing data through multiple layers of components, can lead to unwieldy and hard-to-maintain code. To address this, the app employs a central state management strategy, effectively avoiding the pitfalls of prop drilling. This approach ensures that the application's state is managed efficiently, making the codebase more robust and easier to manage.

## Clean Code Architecture
One of the core principles in the development of this exchange app is maintaining a clean and well-architected codebase. Clean code is not just about following best practices but also about creating a structure that is easy to understand, extend, and maintain. This application was built with careful planning and consideration, ensuring that every part of the code is as clean and efficient as possible. This dedication to clean code makes the project not only functional but also a pleasure to work with.
