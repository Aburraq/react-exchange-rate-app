# Exchange Rate App - React
The Exchange Rate App is a React application designed to provide users with up-to-date exchange rate information. During building process I try to separate apps concerns by organizing code into API, components, pages, providers, and store directories, ensuring a scalable and maintainable codebase.  
Today I added utils and created a logic to some currencies to be seen on top bar. Most of the day I spent my time service layer. Tomorrow I will implement my plans. Hope to not encounter any problems.   
To be contunied..
